   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello my name is Somphang Chanleuxay, most people refer or know me by Pang. 
    I feel I am quite easy to be around sometimes. I tend to try and not take life too seriously, I often do enjoy challenges.
    I make an attempt though to make an effort to be the best I can be and do the best I can. I have a son by the name of Lance. My main drive as it stands is my family.
    Even though I don't take life very seriously, <br> understand that there are circumstances and obstacles I will be faced with that will force me to get out of my comfort zone.
    I always felt at a young age that I wasn't going to be good enough for others, and often sometimes still feel that way.
    I've always felt another reason for me to do better was not only for my family alone but to also show myself that anything is possible. 
    I wanted to do something with tech and found an opportunity to do so through my recent employer. I enjoyed watching shows that had anything to do with science
    or technology. I enjoy watching anime and playing video games. I also enjoy producing music as well.
    As this is one of my first pages being developed, I am having much fun with it. If you'd like to know more about me please reach out.
   </p>
