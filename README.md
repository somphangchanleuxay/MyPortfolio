# <My Portfolio>

## Description

- My motivation is to embark on my journey in coding as this is one of my first  projects given to me to complete, I would like to incorporate most of the things that I have learned so that the knowledge provided to me will stick in some way.
- my goal is to utilize and showcase some the skills that i've learned through the course as well as start a template or portfolio that others are able to see
- This will help anything (Hopefully) that I studied so far and put it into practice, I can also use this page to display what I have done so far and update it for future use for future employers to see
- I learned more about CSS, practice with my sizing, and some HTML about formbox's. I learned about utilizing flew a bit more.
