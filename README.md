# <My Portfolio>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- My motivation is to embark on my journey in coding as this is one of my first  projects given to me to complete, I would like to incorporate most of the things that I have learned so that the knowledge provided to me will stick in some way.
- my goal is to utilize and showcase some the skills that i've learned through the course as well as start a template or portfolio that others are able to see
- This will help anything (Hopefully) that I studied so far and put it into practice, I can also use this page to display what I have done so far and update it for future use for future employers to see
- What did you learn?

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
